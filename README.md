# OpenOLT agent

The *OpenOLT agent* runs on white box Optical Line Terminals (OLTs) and
provides a gRPC-based management and control interface to OLTs.

The OpenOLT agent is used by [VOLTHA](https://github.com/opencord/voltha)
through the [OpenOLT
adapter](https://github.com/opencord/voltha/tree/master/voltha/adapters/openolt).

OpenOLT agent uses Broadcom's BAL (Broadband Adaptation Layer) software for
interfacing with the Maple/Qumran chipsets in OLTs such as the Edgecore/Accton
ASXvOLT16.

## Hardware requirements

A list of tested devices and optics can be found in the [CORD hardware
requirements](https://guide.opencord.org/prereqs/hardware.html#recommended-hardware)
guide, in the *R-CORD access equipment and optics* section.

## Pre-built debian packages of OpenOLT agent for Accton/Edgecore ASFVOLT16/ASGvOLT64

Accton/Edgecore makes available pre-built debian packages of OpenOLT agent to
their customers.  Get access credentials for
[edgecore.quickconnect.to](https://edgecore.quickconnect.to) and then login and
navigate to `File_Station -> EdgecoreNAS`, and then the folder
`/ASXvOLT16/OpenOLT_Agent/From_ONF_Distribution/` and pick the right version of
`.deb` package required for your testing.

`voltha-2.5/openolt_<OPENOLTDEVICE>-2.5.0-<GIT Commit ID>.deb` is the latest version of package with support
for BAL v3.4.7.5 .

The pre-built debian packages have been tested on [Open Networking Linux
(ONL)](http://opennetlinux.org/) version 4.14. The ONL Installer required for
`voltha-2.5/openolt_<OPENOLTDEVICE>-2.5.0-<GIT Commit ID>.deb` is also available at in the same path, i.e.,
voltha-2.5/.

## Install OpenOLT

Copy the debian package to the OLT. For example:

```shell
scp openolt.deb root@10.6.0.201:~/.
```

Install the *openolt.deb* package using *dpkg*:

```shell
dpkg -i openolt_<OPENOLTDEVICE>-2.5.0-<GIT Commit ID>.deb
```

The ONL version required for BAL v3.4.7.5 is ONL `4.14.151-OpenNetworkLinux`. This
will be built as part of build procedure described `Build OpenOLT` section.

## Run OpenOLT as a Linux service

Rebooting the OLT (after the installation) will start `dev_mgmt_daemon` and
`openolt` as system services:

```shell
reboot
```

The services can also be stopped/started manually:

```shell
service dev_mgmt_daemon stop
service openolt stop
service dev_mgmt_daemon start
service openolt start
```

Check the status of the services:

```shell
service dev_mgmt_daemon status
service openolt status
```

## Run OpenOLT in foreground for development and debugging

Running the `dev_mgmt_daemon` and/or `openolt` services in the foreground is
useful for development and debugging. Make sure to first stop the services if
they are running in background.

```shell
service dev_mgmt_daemon stop
service openolt stop
```

Open a terminal and run the Broadcom BAL software (`dev_mgmt_daemon`):

```shell
cd /broadcom
./dev_mgmt_daemon -d -pcie
```

The `dev_mgmt_daemon` executable presents the CLI for Broadcom's BAL when run
in the foreground which is useful for debugging.

While the first executable still runs (even in background), open another
terminal and run `openolt`:

```shell
cd /broadcom
./openolt --interface <interface-name> (or)
./openolt --intf <interface-name>
```

> **NOTE**:

* In the commands above, you should specify OLT management interface name or
  inband interface name if OLT is used in inband mode. Openolt gRPC server
  will start listening on given interface's IP address. If no interface
  specified gRPC server will listen on "0.0.0.0:9191" which will accpet
  requests from any of the interfaces present in OLT.
* The two executables will remain open in the terminals, unless they are put
  in background.

## Inband ONL Note

* Inband ONL image built by packaging Openolt debian package and some startup
  scripts. The startup scripts serve to enable inband channels, create inband
  tagged interfaces, install Openolt debian package and run dev_mgmt_daemon
  and Openolt services.
* Startup script named "start_inband_oltservices.sh" will be executed in
  background after ONL installation. Script execution could be watched in a
  log file located in /var/log/startup.log.
* Follow the procedure specified below in Build OpenOLT section to build
  integrated Inband ONL image.

### Connect from VOLTHA

At the VOLTHA CLI, preprovision and enable the OLT:

```shell
(voltha) preprovision_olt -t openolt -H YOUR_OLT_MGMT_IP:9191
(voltha) enable
```

### Additional notes

* *9191* is the TCP port that the *OpenOLT* agent uses for its gRPC channel.
* In the commands above, you should use OLT inband interface IP address if OLT
  is used in inband mode, otherwise substitute all its occurrences with the
  management IP of your OLT.

## Log Collection for whitebox OLT Device

To collect logs from openolt, dev_mgmt_daemon and syslog processes install td-agent(fluentd variant) directly on OLT device which will capture and transmits the logs to elasticsearch pod running in voltha cluster.

Prerequisite:

OLT should have ntp installed to ensure it has correct time(which is used by td-agent for generated events)

```shell
apt-get install ntp
```

Installation of td-agent deb package:

* Download the deb package for td-agent

```shell
wget http://packages.treasuredata.com.s3.amazonaws.com/3/ubuntu/xenial/pool/contrib/t/td-agent/td-agent_3.8.0-0_amd64.deb
```

* Install td-agent on device

```shell
dpkg -i td-agent_3.8.0-0_amd64.deb
```

Post Installation:

We have created custom td-agent configuration file to handle format of involved log files using right input plugins and elasticsearch output plugin.

Copy the custom config file from [here](https://github.com/opencord/openolt/tree/master/logConf) in the `~` directory of the olt.
Then into the `/etc` folder in order for the agent to pick it up.

```shell
cp td-agent.conf /etc/td-agent.conf
```

* Set elasticsearch host and port in /etc/td-agent.conf
* Restart the td-agent service

```shell
service td-agent restart
```

Need to redirect syslog to default port of fluentd syslog plugin.

* Add  “*.* @127.0.0.1:42185” to  /etc/rsyslog.conf
* Restart syslog using

```shell
/etc/init.d/rsyslog restart
```

**Note**:

To enable TLS encryption features with td-agent [look at this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KF1HhE-PN-VY4JN2bqKmQBrZghFC5HQM_s0mC0slapA/edit)


## Build OpenOLT

### Supported BAL API versions

Currently, OpenOLT supports Broadcom's BAL API, version *3.4.7.5*.

### Proprietary software requirements

The following proprietary source code is required to build the OpenOLT agent.

* `SW-BCM686OLT_<BAL_VER>.tgz` - Broadcom BAL source and Maple SDK
* `sdk-all-<SDK_VER>.tar.gz` - Broadcom Qumran SDK
* `ACCTON_BAL_<BAL_VER>-<ACCTON_VER>.patch` - Accton/Edgecore's patch

The versions currently supported by the OpenOLT agent are:

* `SW-BCM686OLT_3_4_7_5.tgz`
* `sdk-all-6.5.13.tar.gz`
* `ACCTON_BAL_3.4.7.5-V202008030101_rate_limiting_fixed.patch`. This is downloadable from the common CSP CS00003233745. Rename this file as `ACCTON_BAL_3.4.7.5-V202008030101.patch`

> NOTE: the repository does not contain the above three source packages.  These
> are needed to build the OpenOLT agent executable. Contact [Dave Baron at
> Broadcom](mailto:dave.baron@broadcom.com) to access the source packages.

### System Requirements

**Hardware** :

CPU: Dual-core (4 Threads) up.

Memory: 6GB

Storage: 50GB of free space.

**Software** :

1. OpenOLT agent builds on *Debian GNU/Linux 8.11 (jessie)* or *Ubuntu 16.04 LTS*

2. At least 4G of ram and 4G of swap -  compilation is memory intensive

3. Essential tools for building packages

   `apt-get install -y git pkg-config build-essential autoconf libgflags-dev clang libc++-dev unzip libssl-dev gawk debhelper debhelper dh-systemd init-system-helpers curl cmake ccache g++-4.9 wget ca-certificates lcov docker.io`

4. Install cmake version 3.5.0 or above. Download cmake-3.5.0.tar.gz and untar
   it, then in the cmake-3.5.0 directory install by running:

   `./bootstrap && make && make install`

5. Install gRPC version v1.27.1

``` shell
cd /tmp && git clone -b v1.27.1  https://github.com/grpc/grpc /tmp/grpc
cd /tmp/grpc && git submodule update --init
cd /tmp/grpc/third_party/protobuf && ./autogen.sh && ./configure
make && make install && ldconfig
cd /tmp/grpc && make && make install && ldconfig
rm -rf /tmp/grpc
```

Note: Make sure you are using g++-4.9 as the default g++ compiler version on your build system. The grpc libraries and openolt agent code has to be compiled with this g++ version.

### Build procedure

Clone the `openolt` repository either from OpenCORD Gerrit:

```shell
git clone https://gerrit.opencord.org/openolt
```

Copy the Broadcom source and patch files to the openolt/agent/download directory:

```shell
cd <dir containing Broadcom source and patch files>
cp ACCTON_BAL_3.4.7.5-V202008030101.patch SW-BCM686OLT_3_4_7_5.tgz sdk-all-6.5.13.tar.gz <cloned openolt repo path>/agent/download
```

Run the configure script to generate the appropriate Makefile scaffolding for
the desired target:

```shell
cd openolt/agent
./configure
```

Run `make prereq` to install the package dependencies.
This is usually a one-time thing, unless there is a change in the dependencies.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 prereq
```

Run *make*. This can take a while to complete the first time, since it builds
ONL and the Broadcom SDKs. Following runs will be much faster, as they only
build the OpenOLT agent source.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16
```

Note that the required ONL version `4.14` is built as part of the above build
procedure and is available at path
`build/onl/OpenNetworkLinux/RELEASE/jessie/amd64/ONL-onl-4.14_ONL-OS8_2020-01-30.0413-72b95a7_AMD64_INSTALLED_INSTALLER`.
This ONL Installer should be used to flash the OS on the OLT.

If you need to use a specific version of voltha-protos, then specify the git
tag/branch corresponding to that specific version:

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 OPENOLT_PROTO_VER=master
```

By default, the `OPENOLT_PROTO_VER` defaults to git tag *v3.3.6* of the
[voltha-protos](https://gerrit.opencord.org/gitweb?p=voltha-protos.git;a=summary)
repo.

If the build process succeeds, libraries and executables will be created in the
*openolt/agent/build* directory.

Optionally, build the debian package that will be installed on the OLT.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 deb
```

If the build process succeeds, a `.deb` package will be created as well in the
`openolt/agent/build` directory.

Run make with inband option as specified below to build all-in-one ONL image
packed with Openolt debian package and Inband OLT startup scripts(Scripts
to enable Inband channel and start dev_mgmt_daemon and openolt services).
This can take a while to complete the first time, since it builds
ONL and the Broadcom SDKs. Following runs will be much faster, as they try to
build OpenOLT agent source and Inband ONL with modified Openolt deb package.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 INBAND=y VLAN_ID=<INBAND_VLAN>
e.g:
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 INBAND=y VLAN_ID=5
```

If no VLAN_ID is specified in above command it defaults to 4093.

Note that the required INBAND ONL version `4.14` is built as part of the above
build procedure and is available at path
`build/onl/OpenNetworkLinux/RELEASE/jessie/amd64/ONL-onl-4.14_ONL-OS8_2020-04-22.
2206-b4af32e_AMD64_INSTALLED_INSTALLER\.`
This ONL Installer should be used to flash the OS on the OLT.

NOTE: To compile for ASGvOLT 64 port GPON OLT, set `OPENOLTDEVICE` to
`asgvolt64` during build procedure like below.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asgvolt64
```

### Cleanup

To cleanup the repository and start the build procedure again, run:

```shell
# cleans up the agent objects, protos compiled artificats and openolt deb packages
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 clean

# cleans up the agent objects, protos compiled artificats, openolt deb packages and bal sources
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 distclean
```

## FAQ

The information here may be specific to specific OLT and ONU hardware such as
Edgecore ASFVOLT16 OLT and Broadcom based ONUs.

### How to change speed of ASFVOLT16 NNI interface?

Auto-negotiation on the NNI (Network to Network Interface) uplink ports is not
tested.

By default, the OpenOLT agent sets the speed of the NNI interfaces to 100G. To
downgrade the network interface speed to 40G, add the following lines at the
end of the `/broadcom/qax.soc` configuration file.

```text
port ce128 sp=40000
```

A restart of the `dev_mgmt_daemon` and `openolt` services is required after
making this change.


### Why does the Broadcom ONU not forward eapol packets?

The firmware on the ONU is likely not setup to forward 802.1x EAPOL traffic on
the Linux bridge. Drop down to the shell in the Broadcom ONU's console and
configure the Linux bridge to forward 802.1x.

```shell
> sh
# echo 8 > /sys/class/net/bronu513/bridge/group_fwd_mask
```

Version 1.7 of VOLTHA has a known issue where the ONU is only able to pass
EAPOL packets from a specific LAN port (e.g. LAN port 1 on ALPHA ONUs)

### How do I check packet counters on the ONU?

LAN port packet counters:

```shell
bs /b/e port/index=lan{0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
```

WAN port packet counters:

```shell
bs /b/e port/index=wan0
```

### How to get access to MAPLE CLI on OLT box

To get access to the `BCM.0>` maple console, SSH into the OLT and then execute:

```shell
cd /broadcom
./example_user_appl
```

### How do I check packet counters on the OLT's PON interface?

Following is an example of retrieving the interface description for PON
`intf_id 0`

(TODO: document PON interface numbering for Edgecore OLT).

```shell

```

### How do I list flows installed in the OLT?

Following command lists the flows installed on the OLT.

```shell
BCM.0> a/m max_msgs=100 filter_invert=no object=flow
```

### How do I access device CLI when running `dev_mgmt_daemon` and `openolt` agent binary as services?

Navigate to `/opt/bcm68620` and execute the command `/broadcom/dev_mgmt_attach`
to access the QAX diagnostic shell. If you are not able to access the shell,
you need to recompile the BAL SDK with `SW_UTIL_SHELL=y` option set.

### DBA Scheduler fail to create on the OLT with errors related to Bandwidth configuration

Ensure that `additional_bw` indicator in the Technology Profile and the
`bandwidthprofile` configured in ONOS netcfg for the subscriber are following
the below guideline.

* When `additional_bw` is configured as `AdditionalBW_BestEffort`, ensure `cir` + `eir`
  values in ONOS netcfg BW profile for the subscriber are greater than or equal to *16000*
  for XGSPON, and it is greater than equal to *32000* for GPON. Also ensure that `eir`
  is a non-zero value.
* When `additional_bw` is configured as `AdditionalBW_NA`, ensure that both `cir` and `eir`
  are non-zero values, and `cir` + `eir` is greater than or equal to *16000* for XGSPON and
  *32000* for GPON.
* When `additional_bw` is configured as `AdditionalBW_None`, ensure that `eir` is 0 and `cir`
  is non-zero and `cir` is greater than or equal to *16000* for XGSPON, and it is greater than
  equal to *32000* for GPON.

For more details about BW profile parameters, please refer below links.

## Known Issues

* The Minimum BW that should be configured for ITU PON Alloc Object has changed from 16Kbps
  to 32Kbps from BAL3.1 to BAL3.2 release if you are using ALPHA ONUs.
  As per BAL3.x documents, when FEC is disabled, the minimum BW is 16Kbps on the ITU PON Alloc Object.
  This seems to be a discrepancy on the ALPHA ONU. So, ensure that `cir` + `eir` value is greater than
  equal to *32000* for XGSPON use case for ALPHA ONU.
