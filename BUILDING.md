## System Requirements

**Hardware** :

CPU: Dual-core (4 Threads) up.

Memory: 6GB

Storage: 50GB of free space.

**Software** :

1. OpenOLT agent for Accton/Edgecore ASXvOLT16/ASGvOLT64 builds on *Debian GNU/Linux 8.11.1 (jessie)* and for Phoenix/Radisys RLT-3200G-W builds on *Debian GNU/Linux 9.13 (stretch)*. The *Debian 8.11.1 jessie* ISO installer image is downloadble from [here](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/8.11.1/amd64/iso-cd/debian-8.11.1-amd64-netinst.iso) and *Debian 9.13 stretch* ISO installer image is downloadable from [here](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/9.13.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.13.0-amd64-netinst.iso).

2. At least 4G of ram and 4G of swap -  compilation is memory intensive

3. Essential tools for building packages

Install the following packages for Accton/Edgecore ASXvOLT16/ASGvOLT64 based build

   `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git pkg-config build-essential autoconf libgflags-dev clang libc++-dev unzip libssl-dev gawk debhelper debhelper dh-systemd init-system-helpers curl cmake ccache g++-4.9 wget ca-certificates lcov libgoogle-glog-dev libpcap-dev`

Run the below commands to ensure that g++-4.9 and gcc-4.9 are default g++ and gcc compiler versions.

```shell
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9 20
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 20
```

Install the following packages for Phoenix/Radisys RLT-3200G-W based build

   `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git pkg-config build-essential autoconf libgflags-dev clang libc++-dev unzip libssl-dev gawk debhelper debhelper dh-systemd init-system-helpers curl cmake ccache g++ wget ca-certificates lcov libgoogle-glog-dev libpcap-dev libjansson-dev`

Run the below commands to ensure that g++-6 and gcc-6 are default g++ and gcc compiler versions.

```shell
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-6 20
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-6 20
```

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) to install `docker-ce`. It is not necessary to install `docker-ce-cli` and `containerd.io`.

4. Install cmake version 3.5.1 or above.

```shell
cd /tmp
git clone -b v3.5.1 https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake.git
cd /tmp/cmake
./bootstrap
make
sudo make install
```

5. Install gRPC version v1.31.1

``` shell
cd /tmp
git clone -b v1.31.1  https://github.com/grpc/grpc
cd /tmp/grpc
git submodule update --init
mkdir -p cmake/build
cd cmake/build
cmake ../.. -DgRPC_INSTALL=ON                \
            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release       \
            -DgRPC_ABSL_PROVIDER=module     \

sudo make install
# copy library and grpc_cpp_plugin to path below.
sudo cp `find . -name "*.a"` /usr/local/lib/
sudo cp `find . -name grpc_cpp_plugin` /usr/local/bin/
```

6. Install PcapPlusPlus library

```shell
git clone -b v20.08 https://github.com/seladb/PcapPlusPlus.git
cd PcapPlusPlus
./configure-linux.sh â€”default
make all
sudo make install
```

7. Install latest version of Git (optional)

By default the apt-get install an older version of git (2.1.4) on debian jessie 8.11.1. This older version does not support some of the latest git options. You may want to install a later version of git using procedure below.

```shell
sudo apt-get remove --purge git ## Removes older verion of git
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make libssl-dev libghc-zlib-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext unzip
wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/v2.18.0.zip -O git.zip
unzip git.zip
cd git-*
make prefix=/usr/local all
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
```

**Edgecore ASXvOLT16/ASGvOLT64 build environment note** :

1. The build environment has been validated with only Jessie 8.11.1 64bit AMD64 OS only.
2. Make sure you are using g++-4.9 as the default g++ compiler version on your build system. The grpc libraries and openolt agent code has to be compiled with this g++ version.

**Radisys RLT-3200G-W build environment note** :

1. The build environment has been validated with only Stretch 9.13 64bit AMD64 OS only.
2. Make sure you are using g++-6 as the default g++ compiler version on your build system. The grpc libraries and openolt agent code has to be compiled with this g++ version.

## Openolt build procedure for Edgecore ASXvOLT16/ASGvOLT64

Clone the `openolt` repository either from OpenCORD Gerrit:

```shell
git clone https://gerrit.opencord.org/openolt
```

Copy the Broadcom source and patch files to the openolt/agent/download directory:

```shell
cd <dir containing Broadcom source and patch files>
cp ACCTON_BAL_API_3.10.2.2-V202111090101.patch ACCTON_BAL_3.10.2.2-V202111040101-BROADCOM-IP.patch ACCTON_BAL_3.10.2.2-V202111040101.patch SW-BCM686OLT_3.10.2.2.tgz sdk-all-6.5.21.tar.gz <cloned openolt repo path>/agent/download
```

Run the configure script to generate the appropriate Makefile scaffolding for
the desired target:

```shell
cd openolt/agent
./configure
```

Run *make*. This can take a while to complete the first time, since it builds
ONL and the Broadcom SDKs. Following runs will be much faster, as they only
build the OpenOLT agent source.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16
```

Note that the required ONL version `4.14` is built as part of the above build
procedure and is available at path
`build/onl/OpenNetworkLinux/RELEASE/jessie/amd64/ONL-onl-4.14_ONL-OS8_2020-01-30.0413-72b95a7_AMD64_INSTALLED_INSTALLER`.
This ONL Installer should be used to flash the OS on the OLT.

If you need to use a specific version of voltha-protos, then specify the git
tag/branch corresponding to that specific version:

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 OPENOLT_PROTO_VER=master
```

By default, the `OPENOLT_PROTO_VER` defaults to git tag *v5.4.6* of the
[voltha-protos](https://gerrit.opencord.org/gitweb?p=voltha-protos.git;a=summary)
repo.

Optionally, for the NNI port default setting, the options could make the default setting of the NNI port speed.

* 100G port change to 40Gbps speed
```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 PORT_100G_SPEED=40000
```
* 100G port change to 10Gbps speed (use Break-out cable)
```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 PORT_100G_SPEED=10000
```
* 25G port change to 20Gbps speed (Accton/Edgecore ASGvOLT64)
```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asgvolt64 PORT_100G_SPEED=100000 PORT_25G_SPEED=20000
```
* 25G port change to 10Gbps speed (Accton/Edgecore ASGvOLT64)
```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asgvolt64 PORT_100G_SPEED=100000 PORT_25G_SPEED=10000
```
* 25G port change to 1Gbps speed (Accton/Edgecore ASGvOLT64)
```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asgvolt64 PORT_100G_SPEED=100000 PORT_25G_SPEED=1000
```

If the build process succeeds, libraries and executables will be created in the
*openolt/agent/build* directory.

Optionally, build the debian package that will be installed on the OLT.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 deb
```

If the build process succeeds, a `.deb` package will be created as well in the
`openolt/agent/build` directory.

Run make with inband option as specified below to build all-in-one ONL image
packed with Openolt debian package and Inband OLT startup scripts(Scripts
to enable Inband channel and start dev_mgmt_daemon and openolt services).
This can take a while to complete the first time, since it builds
ONL and the Broadcom SDKs. Following runs will be much faster, as they try to
build OpenOLT agent source and Inband ONL with modified Openolt deb package.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 INBAND=y VLAN_ID=<INBAND_VLAN>
e.g:
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 INBAND=y VLAN_ID=5
```

If no VLAN_ID is specified in above command it defaults to 4093.

Note that the required INBAND ONL version `4.14` is built as part of the above
build procedure and is available at path
`build/onl/OpenNetworkLinux/RELEASE/jessie/amd64/ONL-onl-4.14_ONL-OS8_2020-04-22.
2206-b4af32e_AMD64_INSTALLED_INSTALLER\.`
This ONL Installer should be used to flash the OS on the OLT.

NOTE: To compile for ASGvOLT 64 port GPON OLT, set `OPENOLTDEVICE` to
`asgvolt64` during build procedure like below.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asgvolt64
```

## Edgecore ASXvOLT16/ASGvOLT64 build cleanup

To cleanup the repository and start the build procedure again, run:

```shell
# cleans up the agent objects, protos compiled artificats and openolt deb packages
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 clean

# cleans up the agent objects, protos compiled artificats, openolt deb packages and bal sources
make OPENOLTDEVICE=asfvolt16 distclean
```

## Openolt build procedure for Radisys RLT-3200G-W/RLT-1600G-W/RLT-1600X-W

Clone the `openolt` repository either from OpenCORD Gerrit:

```shell
git clone https://gerrit.opencord.org/openolt
```

Copy the Broadcom source and patch files to the openolt/agent/download directory:

```shell
cd <dir containing Broadcom source and patch files>
cp RADISYS_BAL_3.10.2.2_V20211129.patch sdk-all-6.5.21.tar.gz SW-BCM686OLT_3_10_2_2.tgz <cloned openolt repo path>/agent/download
```

Run the configure script to generate the appropriate Makefile scaffolding for
the desired target:

```shell
cd openolt/agent
./configure
```

Run *make*. This can take a while to complete the first time, since it builds
ONL and the Broadcom SDKs. Following runs will be much faster, as they only
build the OpenOLT agent source.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=rlt-3200g-w
```

NOTE:
To compile for Radisys RLT-1600G-W 16 port GPON OLT, set `OPENOLTDEVICE` to
`rlt-1600g-w` during build procedure like below.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=rlt-1600g-w
```

To compile for Radisys RLT-1600X-W 16 port GPON OLT, set `OPENOLTDEVICE` to
`rlt-1600x-w` during build procedure like below.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=rlt-1600x-w
```

Note that the required ONL version `4.19` is built as part of the above build
procedure and is available at path
`build/onl/OpenNetworkLinux/RELEASE/stretch/amd64/ONL-onl-4.19_ONL-OS9_2021-03-30.0455-72b95a7_AMD64_INSTALLED_INSTALLER`.
This ONL Installer should be used to flash the OS on the OLT.

If you need to use a specific version of voltha-protos, then specify the git
tag/branch corresponding to that specific version:

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=rlt-3200g-w OPENOLT_PROTO_VER=master
```

By default, the `OPENOLT_PROTO_VER` defaults to git tag *v5.4.6* of the
[voltha-protos](https://gerrit.opencord.org/gitweb?p=voltha-protos.git;a=summary)
repo.

If the build process succeeds, libraries and executables will be created in the
*openolt/agent/build* directory.

Command to build debian package that will be installed on the OLT with default
QSFP NNI port speed as 40g and SFP NNI port speed as 10g in case of RLT-3200G-w
and RLT-1600G-w and with default QSFP NNI port speed as 100g and SFP NNI port
speed as 25g in case of RLT_1600X-W. NNI port speed configuration not included
during inital make to reduce build time in case of different NNI port speed
requirement.

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=rlt-3200g-w deb
```

Optionally, debian package can be built with other NNI port speed options as below
for RLT-3200G-W/RLT-1600G-W/RLT-1600X-W,

* 40G QSFP NNI port change to 10Gbps speed (use Break-out cable) (Phoenix/Radisys RLT-3200G-W, RLT-1600G-W)

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=rlt-3200g-w deb PORT_QSFP_SPEED=10g PORT_SFP_SPEED=10g
```

* 100G QSFP NNI port change to 40Gbps speed and 25G SFP NNI port change to 10Gbps speed (Phoenix/Radisys RLT-1600X-W)

```shell
make OPENOLTDEVICE=rlt-1600x-w deb PORT_QSFP_SPEED=40g PORT_SFP_SPEED=10g
```

* 100G QSFP NNI port change to 10Gbps speed and 25G SFP NNI port change to 10Gbps speed (Phoenix/Radisys RLT-1600X-W)

```shell
